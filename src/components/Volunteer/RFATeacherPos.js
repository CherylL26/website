                        Lead Instructors are responsible for running Robotics for All classes, managing Teacher Assistants, and checking student homework. They also must ensure that classes run smoothly by helping students with debugging, and addressing any issues with student behavior. Lead Instructors are the highest authority in the class, so they must possess strong leadership and independence.
