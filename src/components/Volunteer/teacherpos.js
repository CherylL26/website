                        Lead Instructors are responsible for running Robotics for All classes, managing Teacher Assistants, and checking student homework. They also must ensure that classes run smoothly by helping students with debugging, and addressing any issues with student behavior. Lead Instructors are the highest authority in the class, so they must possess strong leadership and independence.

                        The teacher's assistant position is the perfect entry level position to teaching. As a teacherâ€™s assistant, you will assist the lead instructor in classes by answering student questions, leading breakout rooms of 3 - 5 students, and reviewing homework.
